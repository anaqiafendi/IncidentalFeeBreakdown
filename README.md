# IncidentalFeeBreakdown
A breakdown of your incidental tuition fees and a look at what they actually support and go to.

University tuition fees are not a trivial thing and are something that many people struggle with financially. They are made especially bad when you're not getting full value out of them, like during this pandemic, and you aren't able to actually USE the on campus facilities. Now you can't see how much of those university/campus activies are funded through the main portion of your tuition fees, which they don't itemize but totally should and should be transparent about. However, you can view how your incidental fees are being used, in what proportion, who they go to and support, and see what you pay for. That's always nice to see what you're actually paying for.
